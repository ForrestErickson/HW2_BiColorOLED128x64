# Summary
Arduino code running on Hardware2 assembly with an I2C OLED 128x64

Version V.0.1 initilized LED and display. It has wink function which blinks the built in LED but does not scroll text. 
A compile time variable can be set to scroll the text in the loop() but it blocks with delay and so the wink is not real time.
